<h1 id="image-location-scanner">Image Location Scanner</h1>

<p>Passively scans for GPS location exposure in images during normal security assessments of websites via a Burp plug-in. Image Location Scanner assists in situations where end users may post profile images and possibly give away their home location, e.g. a dating site or children's chatroom.</p>

<p>A whitepaper / presentation based on a real-world site audit can be found at <a href="http://www.veggiespam.com/ils">http://www.veggiespam.com/ils</a>.</p>

<p>This software finds the GPS information inside of Exif tags, IPTC codes, and proprietary Panasonic/Lumix codes. Then, this scanner flags the findings in the Burp Scanner as an information message. It would be up to the auditor to determine if location exposure is truly a security risk based on context.</p>
